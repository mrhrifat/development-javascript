## Development JavaScript
Before [Development JavaScript](https://github.com/mrhrifat/development-javascript). First we need to know, 
- What is JavaScript JavaScript?
    - JavaScript is the most popular Programming language in the world. Over [97%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-deployedstats-12) of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
- Why JavaScript 
    - Why not? All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. It can be used in Front-end, Back-end, Android, IOS, Desktop & AI also.  So I decided to learn & practice **JavaScript That All Need To Know**. 

Learn more about [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 

**Note:** If you don't know **Basic or Advance JavaScript**. Then you won't be able to Understand **ES6 or Advance/Development JavaScript**. But don't fear, learn **Core to Advance JavaScript** from the repository is given below:
- [JavaScript All You Need To Know](https://github.com/mrhrifat/javascript-all-to-know)
- [Advance JavaScript / ES6](https://github.com/mrhrifat/advance-javascript)

So, let's start learning.

## Motive
It will be helpful for  any future Programmer, who want to learn ES6 or Advance JavaScript  by practice & solving problem. Also for those who won't understand any hard example of any Code Statement. It will be a good experience to for Programmers.

## ES6 / ECMAScript 6
ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 is a significant update to the JavaScript programming language. It is the first major update to the language since ES5 which was standardized in 2009. Therefore, ES2015 is often called ES6. 

**Note:** To follow this ES6 tutorial, you should have a good knowledge of JavaScript up to ES5.

## Why ES6 Instead of Development JavaScript
JavaScript ES6 brings new syntax and new awesome features to make your code more modern and more readable. It allows you to write less code and do more. ES6 introduces us to many great features like arrow functions, template strings, class destruction, Modulesâ€¦ and more.
